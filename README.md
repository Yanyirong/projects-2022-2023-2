# projects-2022-2023-2
This project includes some of the homeworks or projects I have done at 
the second semester of my junior year in SJTU.

Mainly includes four courses:

+ data mining
+ IntelliSense Practice
+ Reinforcement Learning
+ Virtual Reality

If you are a student major in AI in SJTU, you can refer to these projects, which can help you save some time.

But ATTENTION, please do not copy my code directly.You can get some idea from my code, but you should write your own code and finish your own homework.
## data mining
Data mining has five homeworks,you can find them in the folder named data_mining_x.

About HW4,I got 80 scores,which means the codes still have some questions.If you find some bugs,try to fix them by yourself.
## IntelliSense Practice
IntelliSense Practice has six small projects, and I have done four of them.
+ Language Model, see languagemodel folder. This task is mainly to run the model to do comparative experiments, so a sh file can be completed.
+ Image Generation, see vae folder. Reproduced vae and made improvements.
+ Sound Event Detection, see sound_event_detection folder. The implementation ideas and details are described in the report in the folder.
+ Audio-Visual Scene Recognition, see audio_visual_scene folder. Mainly implemented early fusion and late fusion.

## Reinforcement Learning
We have three projects in this course, and only need to choose one of them to do.

Our group chose the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning project.

This project is about the 3v3 greedy snake game.And this projects has a lot of open sources.

See another project named (xxx) for more details.
## Virtual Reality
This course is mainly about the Unity engine, and the final project is to make a game.

I have learned and developed some projects before and the teammate Xu is a fantastic programmer too.

For this project, you can search tutorial videos on Bilibili, and you can also refer to the projects on Github or other websites.

## About this semester
This semester only have few courses, and mainly focus on group projects.

Thanks to all the classmate who have helped me: Rao, Xing, Zheng, Kun, Han, Zhi, Xu, etc.

Best wishes to all of you.
